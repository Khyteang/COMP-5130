Week 10 Tasks:
In term of this application, all the expected features have been implemented and this week tasks were mostly UI cleanup or adding additional features to the UI.
There were no impediments that I had this week since a lot of the heavy lifting were done the few weeks before with the backend work.

Things I did:
-   Created a new tab in the InfoWrapper called Legend
-   Added legend so that users can know what the events are for
-   Migrated the application in weblab per requested by Professor
-   Create Readme with instruction to how to run this project locally and how to use new data from http://hisz.rsoe.hu

I hope those who have followed this project throughout the semester have enjoyed the adventure and hopefully they also like the app as much as I do.
Please feel free to reach out to me if you have ideas or features that you will like to see in this application.
