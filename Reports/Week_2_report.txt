Week 2 Task: Setup Backend and Frontend Frameworks

This week, I set up the frontend framework ReactJS with webpack bundler. 
This week I will also be looking for where I can retrieve these real-time data from.

For the frontend setup, I will be using the webpack as a bundler that will bundle all the codes and dependency into one minified file.
Will be using Babel as a javascript compiler.

Struggles:
When trying to set up webpack and babel to work with reactjs, I had a lot of problems with getting the correct dependency version.
This took a bit of time since there wasn't a tutorial on installing the latest version of all these tools. 
But managed to get it working and playing around more with the flow.
