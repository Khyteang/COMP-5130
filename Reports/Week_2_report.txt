Week 2 Task: Setup Backend and Frontend Frameworks

This week, I set up the frontend framework ReactJS with webpack bundler. 
This week I will also be looking for where I can retrieve these real-time data from.

For the frontend setup, I will be using the webpack as a bundler that will bundle all the codes and dependency into one minified file.
Will be using Babel as a javascript compiler.

Things I did:
-   Setup webpack, babel, and react application
-   Start looking into sources where I can find data for this application (data includes natural disasters that are occurring around the world)

Impediments/Solutions:
When trying to set up webpack and babel to work with reactjs, I had a lot of problems with getting the correct dependency version.
This took a bit of time since there wasn't a tutorial on installing the latest version of all these tools. 
After doing some researches, I came upon this article https://www.valentinog.com/blog/react-webpack-babel/ and despites it not being a straight-forward solution,
I was able to determine the correct version for each dependencies. The result of this week is a working react application.
