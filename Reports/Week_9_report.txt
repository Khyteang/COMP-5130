Week 9 Tasks:
With most of functionalities for this application production ready, I started to integrate a few more feature that helps the users visualize the events that are happening. 
I also modified the InfoWrapper component to include a tab component that has three views: Event Information, Real-Time Tweets, and Donation. 
The purpose of the Event Information is to give a more descriptive of the event and link to learn more about the event. 
The real-time tweet tab contains tweets relating to the event. 
The donation tab has a radar graph which purpose is to display how much others have donated to this event and how much left is needed. 

Things I did:
-	Update InfoWrapper to include tabs for “Event Information”, “Real-Time Tweets”, and “Donation”.
-	Use Reactstrap to implement tabs
-	Add more icons to represent other disaster events
-	Research for React Chart Component Library. Found react-chartjs-2 https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-chartjs-2
-	Implement Radar chart using react-chartjs-2.

There were no impediments for this week given that it was very straightforward with what the tasks for this week were. 
Reactstrap is very simple to implement since it has great documentation for creating tabs (https://reactstrap.github.io/components/tabs/). 
React-Chartjs-2 is also a very simple library to understand and use to create charts.
Great examples of using React-Chartjs-2 at https://github.com/jerairrest/react-chartjs-2/tree/master/example.
The only issue with this application right now is that there aren’t a lot of data regarding each event so the Radar chart contains fake data. 
This isn’t something that will get fixed in this application just because data is sacred.
I also generated a more up-to-date data file in map_event_latest.json which contains a bunch of earthquake events.
