Week 4 Tasks:
Set up express server that can serve the data from the data that I have collected. This REST API endpoint would serve data through the GET request and will be used by the react client.
Set up the integration between the react client and the backend server to collect the data.
Another task for this week is plot all the data on the map and add marker features.
