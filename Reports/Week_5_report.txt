Week 5 Tasks:
Since I don't know how to use weblab to deploy my app, I have to choose a different cloud platform to host my application so that the grader and everyone can have access to it. 
The tasks include determining a platform as a service that can achieve this goal, configuring the application to be able to deploy on that platform, and deploying the application.

Things to do:
-   Research for cloud hosting provider to host application
-   Configure application
-   Host application

I chose Heroku as the cloud platform to host my application given that they have a free tier with 5 servers and it is very easy to deploy my Nodejs application on Heroku using their Heroku CLI which has a git integration. 
I also have to build a production deployment pipeline that Heroku can understand and execute in order to successfully deploy the application. 
The production deployment pipeline is similar to the development pipeline except that I am no longer using Webpack-Dev-Server to serve my index.html and index_bundle.js anymore. 
Instead, I have to update my express app to be able to serve these static files.

Here is the Heroku link to access the application: https://comp-5130.herokuapp.com
