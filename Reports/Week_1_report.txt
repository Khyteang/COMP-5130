Week 1 Task: Determine a project for this class and the tech stack that will be needed

The project that I have chosen for this class is an application that visualize real-time natural disasters that are occurring around the world. 
This idea came from the curiosity that I have about what is going on in this world. 
With the news that focus mostly on local politics or issues happening in our country, we do lack the context of what else are happening around the world today. 
So many people are struggling, and they are not getting the help that we can provide. 
My ideal solution is not just to provide the location of the disasters but to provide links to where users can donate and help those who are affected by the disaster.

Tech Stack:

Backend
1.	Nodejs for javascript runtime environment that can execute the javascript code
2.	Express for creating routing
3.	Redis or maybe just a JSON file for data store
Frontend
1.	Reactjs
2.	HTML/CSS
