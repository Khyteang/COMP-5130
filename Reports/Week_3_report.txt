Week 3 Tasks:
Last week, I have found a reliable source to find real-time data about natural disasters around the world.
http://hisz.rsoe.hu which is an Emergency and Disasters Information Service by the National Association of Radio Distress-Signalling and Infocommunications (RSOE).
Currently, I am not making any request to their endpoint to grab the real-time data, I just have a local copy of the disasters that are happening within a set period.
Will be using this data (currently in the Data folder) to plot onto the map.

Started to look into how I can integrate Google Map API into the application.
Also I found that I can use this npm package called google-maps-react which is a declarative Google Map React component that I can easily integrate into my web application.
In this week, I included the json data for the natural disasters that are currently occurring and I integrated Google Map and plotted a few of the markers.
