COMP-5130: Internet & Web Systems I

Project AngelHub
This application is about learning and being aware of natural disaster events that are occurring around the world at this moment. 
We live in the world where accessing data is at the tip of our fingers but the data that we are fed by the news sources in our community are news about politics or celebrities. 
This application can help users to become aware of the suffering that others are enduring on the other side of the country and to provide helps through donation or spreading the awareness to their community. 
This application contains real-live data that are projected onto an interactive map that users can select and move around in order to learn more about the disasters. 
Also, there are information regarding the event such as location, affected area, donation information, and real-live tweets that are coming in through social media regarding that event. 
Some benefits of using this application include knowing parts of the world that you can avoid for your next destination trip or knowing that your love ones who live in the other part of the world are okay.
